The Career Recommendation Web App is a full-stack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that helps students and job-seekers discover the most suitable career paths based on their skills, interests, and personality traits.

By integrating a smart AI-powered assessment system, the app provides personalized career suggestions and insights, enabling users to make informed decisions about their future.
